Crosscloud.js embodies a radical approach to Web Application
development: it puts the data under user control. This actually makes
things better for application developer, too.  When used properly,
crosscloud.js tends to make applications:

* **Fast:** With simple data flows, applications are often highly
    responsive, especially for multi-user features

* **Easy to Develop:** You only need to think about front end
    development, and the model is pretty simple.  (Of course, this is
    partially a matter of taste.  But we like it.)

* **Secure:** Data security becomes the responsibility of the storage
    provider, not your application

* **Scalable:** Whether you have 5 users or 5 million, your code
    remains the same.  The Crosscloud platform handles the data
    scaling (or will, in theory!).

* **Polite:** By letting users control their own data and switch
    between apps when they want to, you are respecting their freedom,
    individuality, and privacy.  Isn't that what everyone should do?

* **Integrated:** Using Semantic Web techniques, Crosscloud
    applications are able to interoperate with each other via shared
    data and overlapping *vocabularies*.  Threaded comments are
    threaded comments, calendar events are calendar events, etc, no
    matter which apps want to use them.

If your app were all these things, would your users be delighted?

On the other hand, crosscloud.js and the crosscloud system is:

* **Not ready for "production" use:** This is currently a research
    project at MIT CSAIL.

* **Not stable:** We're constantly tinkering with the APIs. We do
    versioning so your code wont break immediately, but we might
    remove any feature with only 60-days notice, to avoid the drag of
    old code.

* **Not decentralized yet:** The servers are partial mock-ups right now,
    helping us understand the desired functionality. They'll work
    great for your app, but wont actually give users the promised
    freedom (yet) and certainly wont scale to millions of users.
